# 53bit-ids

Consider the task of generating random 53-bit integers (the maximum size safely representable in Javascript) in order to count the number of duplicate numbers generated by chance. The algorithm is simple:

  1. Create an empty map/object/set called `generated`
  2. Generate a new random 53-bit integer called `N`
  3. If `N` exists in the set, increment a counter for the number of collisions
  4. Add `N` to `generated`
  5. Go to step 2
  
This repository contains small programs in the following languages/runtimes that implement this algorithm:

  1. C++, compiled with `--std=c++11 -O3 -march=native`
  2. Python2, run with CPython and PyPy
  3. Python3 
  4. node.js LTS version (6.11.0), run with `--max-old-space-size=2048 --noturbo`
  
Memory was limited to 2 GB via bash `ulimit`. In all cases, the highest number of duplicates seen across multiple runs was **1**.
Results as follows:
